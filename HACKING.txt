Development setup
=================

Backy is intended to be compatible with Python 3.10. It is expected to work
properly on Linux and Mac OS X, even though specific backends may not be
available on all platforms. Use `poetry` to get a development setup::

    $ git clone https://github.com/flyingcircusio/backy.git
    $ cd backy
    $ poetry install
    or
    $ nix develop


Running tests
=============

Backy has some end-to-end tests which take a while. To run only quick unit
tests::

    $ pytest -m "not slow"

To run all tests::

    $ pytest


Releasing
=========
Install `zest.releaser` (`nix develop`) on your workstation. Then use::

    $ fullrelease

To upload the docs, check out the last release tag and run::

    $ bin/buildout
    $ bin/python setup.py upload_docs --upload-dir doc/_build/html
